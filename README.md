## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The project follows a structured SDLC approach to ensure clarity, organization, and quality.

### 1. Requirement Analysis

User needs were analyzed through basic user stories and feature prioritization. The focus was on core functionality that delivers the most value while remaining feasible within the project timeline.

**Functional Requirements**:

* User registration and login
* Item listing with images and descriptions
* Search and browse functionality
* Messaging between users
* Category management
* Admin controls for moderation

**Non-Functional Requirements**:

* Performance: Fast response and loading times
* Scalability: Support growth in users and listings
* Security: Protection of user data
* Usability: Simple and intuitive interface
* Reliability: Stable system behavior
* Maintainability: Clean and modular code structure

### 2. System Design

The system is designed using a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns. The backend exposes RESTful APIs, which are consumed by the frontend. The database schema ensures relational integrity, and UI wireframes guide the frontend layout and flow.

### 3. Implementation

Development was carried out following coding standards and best practices. GitHub was used for version control with feature branches and pull requests. Responsibilities were divided between frontend and backend to allow parallel development.

### 4. Testing

Testing includes unit testing for individual components, integration testing for API interactions, and usability testing to ensure the application meets user expectations.

### 5. Deployment

The application is deployed using cloud-based platforms to ensure accessibility and reliability. Monitoring tools are used to track performance and uptime.

### 6. Maintenance

Ongoing maintenance includes bug fixes, performance improvements, and feature enhancements based on user feedback. The project is designed to support long-term evolution.
